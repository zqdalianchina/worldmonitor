// v12 bump for PR 3A §net-imports denominator (plan

// `tradeSanctions` → `tradePolicy` rename + dropped OFAC component +
// reweighted trade-policy formula. Without the bump, v12 entries would
// serve pre-rename economic-domain scores for the full 6h TTL post-deploy.
// v13→v14 bump in plan 2026-04-25-004 Phase 2 (Ship 2) for the new
// `financialSystemExposure` dim — adds a 20th dimension contributing to
// the economic domain, so v13 entries (which lack the new dim's score)
// would surface incomplete payloads on cache hit.

// (50/0.3) instead of "stable-absence" (85/0.6) for non-comprehensive
// sources (U5); event-counted dims (socialCohesion unrest, borderSecurity
// UCDP) normalize per-million-population (U6). Every country's score
// shifts; mixing v15 + v16 cached scores in the same response would
// create internally-inconsistent rankings.
// v16→v17 bump for plan 2026-04-26-002 §U7 (PR 6): `headlineEligible`
// flips from PR 2's "true everywhere" to actual eligibility logic
// (coverage >= 0.65 AND (population >= 200k OR coverage >= 0.85) AND
// !lowConfidence). Cached v16 score entries carry headlineEligible:true
// for every country (the PR 2 default), which would let ineligible
// countries through the headline ranking filter for the full 6h TTL
// post-deploy. Bump forces a clean recompute aligned with the new gate.
// v17→v18 bump for plan 2026-04-26-002 §U8.1 (net-imports denominator
// extended from sovereignFiscalBuffer to liquidReserveAdequacy). The
// `_formula` tag is binary 'd6'|'pc' and does NOT detect intra-'d6'
// scorer-formula changes — without this bump, cached v17 AE/PA scores
// (gross-imports-denominated) would continue to serve for the full 6h
// TTL post-deploy, defeating the construct fix this PR delivers. Same
// pattern as the v11→v12 bump that PR 3A used for the SWF-side fix.
// v18→v19 bump for issue #3971: cyberDigital now caps the per-snapshot
// severity-weighted cyber threat count before normalization. The `_formula`
// tag does not distinguish intra-formula scorer changes, so cached v18
// scores would otherwise serve pre-cap cyberDigital values until TTL.
// v19→v20 bump for country-resilience audit P1-3: freshness/staleness
// now derates confidence coverage and therefore can change lowConfidence
// plus headlineEligible. Scores are unchanged, but cached v19 score
// payloads already carry the old confidence/eligibility booleans.
// v20→v21 bump for the P1-1 CRI contract fix: pillar member domains now
// use domain.weight * average dimension coverage inside the active `pc`
// formula. The `_formula` tag remains `pc`, so the prefix bump is required
// to reject old same-tag pillar scores deterministically at deploy. v20 is
// reserved for the parallel staleness-derate rollout, so this branch sequences
// the next same-tag `pc` formula change into v21.
// v21→v22 bump for country-resilience audit round 2 P2-N2/P2-N3:
// currencyExternal now scores inflation stability around a low-positive target
// band instead of treating deflation/0% inflation as perfect, and blend math
// rejects NaN scores rather than consuming their weights.

//
//   1. Avoid the Upstash REST write→re-read visibility lag. A /pipeline GET of
//      freshly-SET keys in the same Vercel invocation can return null even
//      when every SET succeeded — the pre-existing post-warm re-read tripped
//      this and silently dropped the ranking publish. See
//      `feedback_upstash_write_reread_race_in_handler.md`.
//   2. Still detect actual write failures. `cachedFetchJson`'s underlying
//      `setCachedJson` only logs and swallows on error, which would make a
//      transient /set failure look like a successful warm and publish a
//      ranking aggregate over missing per-country keys.
//
// The pipeline SET response is the authoritative persistence signal: it's
// synchronous with the write, so "result: OK" per command means the key is
// actually stored. We compute scores in memory (no caching), persist in one
// pipeline, and only include countries whose SET returned OK in the returned
// map. Callers should merge the map directly into their local `cachedScores`
// — no post-warm Redis re-read.
